Proposal **BIP148-201704**, in following way:

**In the case that at least _80%_ of entities from Entity List will also Sign this documents
in their own name, on same conditions as this conditions here,
then we will Execute Support for Proposal.**

**Our Vote on the Proposal is:** (((WILL VOTE LATER / AGREED / DECLINED))).

If we did not Voted yet (option other then AGREED or DECLINED is selected above),
then wee promise that before {{{SELECTED DATE}}} we will publish our signed Vote
on this matter.

Definitions:

**Vote**: act of voting means filling in and Sign-ing this document
while also selecting option either
"AGREED" or "DECLINED" in the line above with "Our Vote on the Proposal is".
+ Such signed document must be published before the date specified above.
+ Such Vote should be given only 1 time (not counting "WILL VOTE LATER" or other
invalid votes).

**Sign**: by signing we mean signing with a crypto public key (well known
to belong to given Entity, PGP or Bitcoin signature) agreement identical to this one, but with
filled in details of the other Entity (and possibly other Date).

**Vote**: is do we SUPPORT or ABSTAIN this Proposal.

**Entity List** is the list of entities that is in document with SHA512 checksum:
{{{TO BE FILLED WHEN ENTITY LIST IS FINALIZED}}}.

**Proposal** is the text of BIP148, as defined by document {{{TO BE FILLED WHEN SOME BIP148 DRAFT IS MORE FINALIZED}}}.

**Execute Support** - by executing support for that Proposal, we mean taking following actions, during all time
starting from no later then {{{EXECUTE START DATE}}} up until at least {{{EXECUTE END DATE}}}:
1. We will Support the Bitcoins that are valid according to Bitcoin Blockchain rules
resulting from applying BIP defined in Proposal to Bitcoin Core Version {{{Latest stable version of Bitcoin Core given by hash}}}
1. by Supporting Bitcoins we mean that we will process the payments, withdrawals, and other Bitcoin transactions and operations, and we will also refer to such supported Bitcoins as the "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoins" in our business:
+ We will clearly mark such defined Bitcoins as the Bitcoins we primarly support (though we might also trade other bitcoins, marking them clearly as alternative version).
+ All agreements with our customers that we made beforehand in regards to "Bitcoin" will be executed as agreements to such-defined Bitcoin.
1. If Bitcoin project will adopt additional updates during the Execute Support time, we are free to run them, or other modifications, as long as the main rules proposed in the BIP stay in effect.
1. For clarity, we define the expected result of the rules from this BIP as following:
+ Blocks mined between August 1 of year 2017, and November 15 of year 2017, will be rejected (ignored by us) if they do not include bitcoin signaling (BIP9) to activate BIP141, BIP143 and BIP147. 
+ If this creates any kind of fork of Blockchain, e.g. chain split, we will fully such-defined coins.
