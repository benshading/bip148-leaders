Leaders of Bitcoin industry could sign an agreement to 
**conditionally** support and coordinate
rolling out support for SegWit/BIP148 (or other future proposals):

I will promote .... as Bitcoin, **IF at least 80% of other actors also say so too**.

Pros of such agreement:
* The leaders can safely support it, with no fear to be left behind in minority.
* BIPs that are in demand by majority of economy behind Bitcoin can be supported - even if miners would be rogue (e.g. favoring short-term income wit patented ASICBOOST tricks).

1. Create list of the biggest actors: exchanges, pools, e-shops and such.
2. Publish that list here.
3. Create proposed agreement, e.g. to promote [BIP148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0148.mediawiki) as the Bitcoin they support **if 80% of other actors also vote sign this agreement and vote YES to support it**.
4. Contact each players to get his official public promise that he will support this conditions.
5. **If selected threshold of support is reached**: all Players will do as they agreed, or face losing credibility in provable way.
